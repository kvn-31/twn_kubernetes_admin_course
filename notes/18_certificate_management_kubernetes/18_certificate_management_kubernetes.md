# Certificate Management in Kubernetes
- certificates expire -> admin needs to manage them
  - CA valid for 10 years
  - certificates valid for 1 year

## Check Certificate Expiration
- certificates are stored in `/etc/kubernetes/pki`, generated by kubeadm
- `sudo kubeadm certs check-expiration` -> checks the expiration of the certificates
- to check low-level certificates, use `openssl x509 -in /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt -text -noout` -> to check the details
- when updating the cluster, kubeadmin will renew the certificates -> best practice
- `kubeadm certs renew X` -> renew the certificate(s)
